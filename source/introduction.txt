Getting Started

Simple Example
--------------

To start with our tutorial we create the simplest program possible.
This program will create an empty 200 x 200 pixel window. 
Note that the appearance of the window will depend on your current GNOME theme.

We will now explain each line of the example.

We start the program with a `shebang-directive <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>`_, 
which tells the operating system what interpreter to use to execute the file. Most commonly, gjs should
be available in /usr/bin/gjs, but this could be different for your system. If gjs
is available in your path, you can find its precise location by executing "which gjs".
