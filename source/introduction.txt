Getting Started
===============

Simple Example
--------------

To start with our tutorial we create the simplest program possible.
This program will create an empty 200 x 200 pixel window. 
Note that the appearance of the window will depend on your current GNOME theme.

We will now explain each line of the example.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/simple_example.js

We start the program with a `shebang-directive <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>`_, 
which tells the operating system what interpreter to use to execute the file. This is strictly 
speaking not necessary, but makes it possible to launch the program directly, just as with 
native executables on the system. Most commonly, gjs should
be available in /usr/bin/gjs, but this could be different for your system. If gjs
is available in your path, you can find its precise location by executing "which gjs".

We start by importing the Gtk library. This is done through Gjs' imports statement.
Gtk is one of the libraries that make use of GObject introspection, and is therefore 
listed under the gi collection.

After we have imported Gtk, we must initialize it. 
The init function takes as its argument a list of strings, the command line options passed to your program.
It is, however, ok to pass null to Gtk.init if commandline handling is not required. A failure to initialize
the Gtk library can lead to your program terminating unexpectedly with a segmentation fault.
